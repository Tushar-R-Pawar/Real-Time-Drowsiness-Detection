# Driver Drowsiness Detection using Facial Landmarks
This repository contains a Python script that uses computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness based on facial landmarks. The script utilizes OpenCV, dlib, and imutils libraries to capture video from a webcam, detect faces, and analyze the eye blink patterns to determine the drowsiness level of the person.


 

**Features:-**

->Real-time drowsiness detection using facial landmarks

->Calculates blink ratios to determine the drowsiness level

->Displays status messages on the video stream indicating the person's state (awake, drowsy, or sleeping)

->Draws facial landmarks and bounding boxes around detected faces
